# Secure Poem Management System Guide

## üîí **Admin-Only Poetry Management**

Your poetry website now includes a **secure admin system** that ensures only you (as the creator) can add, edit, and manage poems. Visitors can read your poetry, but only you can modify the content!

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features:**

### **Admin Authentication**
- **Password Protection**: Only you know the admin password
- **Session Management**: Auto-logout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Secure Storage**: Admin session stored locally and securely
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear admin mode indicators when logged in

### **Public vs Admin View**
- **Public Visitors**: Can only read poems (no management buttons visible)
- **Admin (You)**: See all management controls when logged in
- **Automatic Protection**: All editing functions require admin authentication

## üîë **Admin Access:**

### **Default Password**
- Current admin password: `poet2025!`
- **Important**: Change this in `secure-poem-manager.js` (line 8)
- Look for: `this.adminPassword = 'poet2025!';`
- Replace with your own secure password

### **How to Login as Admin**
1. Visit your website
2. Click **"Admin Login"** button
3. Enter your admin password
4. You'll see "Admin Mode" indicator in the header
5. All poem management controls become visible

## üéØ **Admin Features Available:**

### **1. Add New Poems**

- Fill in the secure form with:
  - **Title** (required): Your poem's title
  - **Subtitle** (optional): A brief description or theme
  - **Content** (required): Your full poem text
  - **Tags** (optional): Keywords separated by commas

### **2. Edit Existing Poems**
- Click **"Edit"** button on any poem card (admin only)
- Modify the poem details in the form

- **Secure**: No admin controls visible without authentication

## ÔøΩ **Customizing Your Admin Password:**

### **Step 1: Open the secure-poem-manager.js file**
### **Step 2: Find line 8:**
```javascript
this.adminPassword = 'poet2025!'; // Change this to your desired password
```
### **Step 3: Replace with your secure password:**
```javascript
this.adminPassword = 'YourNewSecurePassword123!';
```
### **Step 4: Save the file and push to GitHub**
